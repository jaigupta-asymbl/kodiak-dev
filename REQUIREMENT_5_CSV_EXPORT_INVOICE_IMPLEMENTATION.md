# Requirement 5: CSV Export Invoice System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the CSV export system for invoices that allows system administrators to export finalized invoices to CSV format using configurable field mappings. The system provides a dedicated Lightning tab with an intuitive interface for selecting and exporting invoices while automatically updating their status to "Exported".

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Custom Metadata Type: Invoice_CSV_Field_Mapping__mdt

#### Purpose
Provides flexible, configurable mapping between CSV column headers and Salesforce field API names without requiring code changes.

#### Fields Structure:
- **`CSV_Column_Header__c`** (Text, 255) - Header label for CSV column
- **`Object_API_Name__c`** (Text, 255) - Source object (Invoice__c, Invoice_Line_Item__c, Static)
- **`Field_API_Name__c`** (Text, 255) - Field API name or special value (Sequence, Static_Value)
- **`Default_Value__c`** (Text, 255) - Default/static value when field is empty
- **`Sort_Order__c`** (Number, 3,0) - Column order in CSV output
- **`Is_Active__c`** (Checkbox) - Whether field is included in export

#### Sample Configurations:
```
1. Sequence Number: 
   - Header: "[Sequence]"
   - Object: "Special" 
   - Field: "Sequence"
   - Order: 1

2. Customer ID:
   - Header: "[Invoice:Customer]"
   - Object: "Invoice__c"
   - Field: "Account__r.External_Customer_ID__c"
   - Order: 2

3. Static Values:
   - Header: "[Invoice:SourceModule]"
   - Object: "Static"
   - Field: "Static_Value"
   - Default: "SL"
   - Order: 5
```

### 2. InvoiceCSVExportService Apex Class

#### Core Methods

**`getFinalizedInvoices()`** [@AuraEnabled]
- Retrieves all invoices with Status__c = 'Finalized'
- Includes related Account and Billing Profile data
- Returns formatted data for Lightning Web Component consumption
- Handles exceptions with user-friendly error messages

**`exportInvoicesToCSV(List<Id> invoiceIds)`** [@AuraEnabled]
- Main export orchestration method
- Validates invoice selection and status
- Generates CSV content using field mappings
- Updates invoice status to 'Exported'
- Returns comprehensive ExportResult with success/error details

#### CSV Generation Logic

**Field Mapping Resolution:**
- Retrieves active Custom Metadata records ordered by Sort_Order__c
- Supports multiple object sources (Invoice__c, Invoice_Line_Item__c)
- Handles special cases (Sequence numbers, Static values)
- Manages related field access (e.g., Account__r.Name)

**Row Generation Strategy:**
- Creates one CSV row per Invoice Line Item
- Invoices without line items generate single row
- Sequential numbering across all rows
- Proper CSV escaping for special characters

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout
- Field-level error recovery with default values
- User-friendly error messages for UI consumption
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

- **Integration Coverage**: Custom Metadata and relationship testing

### 7. Configuration Requirements

#### Custom Metadata Setup:
Administrators need to configure CSV field mappings based on business requirements:

```apex
// Example metadata configuration
Invoice_CSV_Field_Mapping__mdt mapping = new Invoice_CSV_Field_Mapping__mdt(
    DeveloperName = 'Invoice_Customer',
    CSV_Column_Header__c = '[Invoice:Customer]',
    Object_API_Name__c = 'Invoice__c',
    Field_API_Name__c = 'Account__r.External_Customer_ID__c',
    Sort_Order__c = 2,
    Is_Active__c = true
);
```

#### Permission Requirements:
- **System Administrator Profile**: Full access to Invoice Export tab
- **Invoice Object**: Read access for data retrieval
- **Custom Metadata Types**: Read access for field mappings
- **Apex Classes**: Execute permission for service methods

#### App Configuration:
1. Add Invoice_CSV_Export tab to Asymbl Time App
2. Configure tab visibility for System Administrator profile
3. Set up navigation menu positioning
4. Test accessibility and mobile responsiveness

## User Experience Workflow
