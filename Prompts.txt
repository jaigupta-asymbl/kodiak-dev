│   multiple excel type cells to enter data and in the end Edit, Delete, Save Icons. At the top, it should     │
│   contain save all button. A lookup field to contact at the beginning to select contact with active          │
│   placements. As soon as contact is selected, placement column should be populated automatically, and        │
