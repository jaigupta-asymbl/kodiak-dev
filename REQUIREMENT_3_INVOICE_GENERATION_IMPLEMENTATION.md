# Requirement 3: Invoice Generation from Timesheets Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the automated invoice generation system that creates invoices and invoice line items from approved timesheets. The system provides seamless integration between timesheet data and invoice management with intelligent consolidation and update capabilities.

## Requirements Analysis

### Source Documents Reviewed
1. **Main Invoicing Requirement Folder** - Primary business requirements and workflow specifications
2. **Requirement 3 Folder** - Specific invoice generation requirements and technical specifications
3. **Change Order Documentation** - Additional requirements and edge cases
4. **Requirement from Erin** - Client-specific billing profile configurations
5. **Kodiak Pivot PDF** - Business process flow and automation triggers

### Key Business Requirements
1. **Default Status**: Timesheet and time entry status must default to "Approved"
2. **Invoice Trigger**: "Create Invoice" checkbox on timesheets triggers automatic invoice generation
3. **Smart Consolidation**: Invoices are created or updated based on account and time period
4. **Billing Profile Integration**: Invoice status and behavior driven by billing profile settings
5. **Line Item Generation**: Detailed line items created from time entry data with proper rates
6. **Future-Proof Updates**: System handles new timesheet data for existing invoices gracefully

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components
1. **InvoiceGenerationService** - Main business logic for invoice creation and updates
2. **TimesheetInvoiceGenerationTrigger** - Automation trigger for timesheet changes
3. **TimesheetInvoiceGenerationBatch** - Asynchronous processing for governor limit handling
4. **Enhanced Field Structure** - Additional fields for tracking and invoice periods

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Timesheet Object Enhancements

#### New Fields Added:
- **`Create_Invoice__c`** (Checkbox)
  - Purpose: User-controlled trigger for invoice generation
  - Default: false
  - Behavior: When checked, initiates invoice creation process

- **`Invoice_Generation_Status__c`** (Picklist)
  - Values: Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed
  - Purpose: Track invoice generation progress
  - Automation: Updated by batch process

- **`Invoice_Generation_Error__c`** (Long Text)
  - Purpose: Store error messages if invoice generation fails
  - Visibility: Helps troubleshooting and user feedback

#### Status Default Update:
- **`ASYMBL_Time__Status__c`** now defaults to "Approved"
- Applied in `TimesheetEntryController.cls` line 100
- Ensures timesheets are ready for invoice generation upon creation

### 2. Invoice Object Enhancements

#### New Fields Added:
- **`Invoice_Period_Start__c`** (Date)
  - Purpose: Track the start date of work period covered by invoice
  - Used for consolidation logic and preventing duplicates

- **`Invoice_Period_End__c`** (Date) 
  - Purpose: Track the end date of work period covered by invoice
  - Used for consolidation logic and preventing duplicates

### 3. Invoice Line Item Object Enhancements

#### New Fields Added:
- **`Timesheet__c`** (Lookup to Timesheet)
  - Purpose: Maintain traceability between line items and source timesheets
  - Enables updates and audit trails

- **`Date_Worked__c`** (Date)
  - Purpose: Track specific work date for detailed billing
  - Supports daily breakdown of hours and rates

### 4. InvoiceGenerationService Class

#### Core Methods:

**`processTimesheetsForInvoicing(List<Id> timesheetIds)`**
- Main entry point for invoice generation
- Validates timesheet data and billing profiles
- Groups timesheets by consolidation criteria
- Returns comprehensive result object with success/error details

**`getTimesheetsWithDetails(List<Id> timesheetIds)`**
- Retrieves timesheets with all related data in single query
- Includes placement, billing profile, and time entry details
- Filters for approved timesheets with Create Invoice = true

**`validateTimesheetData(List<ASYMBL_Time__Timesheet__c> timesheets)`**
- Validates billing profile is active
- Ensures placement has associated account
- Confirms time entries exist for invoice generation
- Throws descriptive errors for failed validations

**`groupTimesheetsByInvoiceCriteria(List<ASYMBL_Time__Timesheet__c> timesheets)`**
- Groups timesheets by Account + Time Period for consolidation
- Creates InvoiceData wrapper objects for processing
- Extensible design for additional grouping criteria

**`createOrUpdateInvoice(InvoiceData invoiceData)`**
- Checks for existing invoices in same period
- Creates new invoice or updates existing based on business rules
- Sets invoice status based on billing profile approval requirements
- Calculates total amounts from line item data

### 5. Automation and Processing

#### Trigger Logic (`TimesheetInvoiceGenerationTrigger`):
```apex
// Detects when Create Invoice checkbox changes to true
if (ts.Create_Invoice__c == true && 
    (oldTs.Create_Invoice__c != ts.Create_Invoice__c || 
     oldTs.ASYMBL_Time__Status__c != ts.ASYMBL_Time__Status__c)) {
    
    // Only process approved timesheets
    if (ts.ASYMBL_Time__Status__c == 'Approved') {
        timesheetsToProcess.add(ts.Id);
    }
}
```

#### Asynchronous Processing (`TimesheetInvoiceGenerationBatch`):
- Implements Queueable interface for reliable async execution
- Handles governor limits for large timesheet batches
- Updates timesheet records with processing status and errors
- Provides comprehensive logging and error tracking

### 6. Business Logic Implementation

#### Invoice Status Determination:
```apex
// Based on billing profile approval requirement
Billing_Profile__c bp = getBillingProfile(invoiceData.billingProfileId);
if (bp.Approval_Required__c == 'Yes') {
    invoice.Status__c = 'Needs Review';
} else {
    invoice.Status__c = 'Ready';
}
```

#### Invoice Consolidation Logic:
- **New Invoice**: Created when no existing invoice found for account + time period
- **Update Invoice**: Updates existing invoice when found for same account + time period
- **Line Item Management**: Deletes old line items and recreates from current timesheet data

#### Rate Structure (Configurable):
- **Regular Hours**: $50.00/hour (placeholder - to be integrated with placement rates)
- **Overtime Hours**: $75.00/hour (1.5x regular rate)
- **Double Time**: $100.00/hour (2.0x regular rate)
- **Future Enhancement**: Integration with placement-specific billing rates

### 7. Error Handling and Validation

#### Client-Side Validations:
- Billing profile must be active
- Placement must have associated account
- Timesheet must have time entries
- Time entries must have valid hours data

#### Server-Side Error Handling:
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks in all methods
- Descriptive error messages for troubleshooting
- Status tracking on timesheet records
- Rollback capabilities for failed transactions

#### Edge Case Handling:
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks existing invoices before creation
- **Zero Hour Handling**: Skips line items with zero hours
- **Null Data Protection**: Validates all required fields before processing
- **Governor Limit Management**: Async processing for large batches

### 8. Integration Points

#### With Existing Invoice System:
- Leverages existing Invoice__c and Invoice_Line_Item__c objects
- Integrates with billing profile configurations
- Maintains existing field relationships and workflows

#### With Timesheet System:
- Uses existing ASYMBL_Time objects
- Preserves existing timesheet workflow
- Adds non-intrusive fields for invoice generation

#### With Placement/Account System:
- Uses existing placement-to-account relationships
- Leverages billing profile configurations
- Maintains data integrity across objects
