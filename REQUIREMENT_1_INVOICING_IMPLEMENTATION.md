# Requirement 1: Kodiak Invoicing System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the Kodiak invoicing system based on requirements analysis from multiple PDF documents and integration with the existing ASYMBL_Time package.

## Requirements Analysis
Analyzed three key requirement documents:
1. **Main Invoicing Requirements** - Core object model and business logic
2. **Change Order Review.pdf** - Additional features for credit memos, timesheet proofing, and paycode management
3. **Kodiak Invoicing Requirements - From Erin.pdf** - Detailed field specifications and invoice splitting requirements

### 3. Business Logic Implementation

#### Validation Rules

**bpats__Job__c.Require_Active_Billing_Profile**
```
AND(
  NOT(ISBLANK(bpats__Account__c)),
  ISBLANK(Billing_Profile__c)
)
```
*Ensures billing profile selection when creating jobs.*

**bpats__Job__c.Prevent_Inactive_Billing_Profile**
```
AND(
  NOT(ISBLANK(Billing_Profile__c)),
  TEXT(Billing_Profile__r.Status__c) = "Inactive"
)
```
*Prevents selection of inactive billing profiles on new jobs.*

#### Flow Automation

**Inherit_Billing_Profile_From_Job**
- **Type**: Record-Triggered Flow (After Save)
- **Object**: bpats__Placement__c
- **Trigger**: When placement is created with associated job
- **Logic**: Automatically inherits billing profile from job to placement
- **Filter Conditions**:
  - Job is not blank
  - Placement billing profile is blank  
  - Job has billing profile assigned

### 4. Key Business Processes Supported

#### Timesheet Proofing Workflow
1. Timesheets start with "Needs Proofing" status
2. Pay/Bill specialists review and update status to "In Review"
3. Cross-specialist proofing (Specialist A reviews B's work, etc.)
4. Final approval to "Approved for Invoicing" status
5. Tracking of who performed the proofing via `Proofed_By__c` field

#### Credit Memo Process
1. **Scenario 1**: Simple credit amounts without original invoice relationship
2. **Scenario 2**: Revision credits with original invoice reference using sequential numbering (e.g., 12234.1)
3. Support for negative amounts with validation
4. Ability to edit invoice lines manually for adjustments

#### Per Diem and Adjustment Tracking
- Separate pay and bill amounts for per diem
- Manual adjustments for reimbursements, bonuses, rate overrides
- Flexible adjustment types to support various business scenarios

#### Multiple Billing Profiles
- One or more billing profiles per company
- Job-level billing profile assignment
- Automatic inheritance from job to placement
- Inactive profile restrictions while preserving existing placements

### 5. Deployment Package
Created comprehensive deployment package (`invoicing-deployment-package.xml`) containing:

- **7 Custom Objects**: Complete object definitions
- **31 Custom Fields**: All new and enhanced fields
- **2 Validation Rules**: Business logic enforcement
- **1 Flow**: Automated billing profile inheritance

### 6. Data Model Relationships

```

├── Billing_Profile__c (1:Many)
│   ├── Additional_Emails__c (Many:Many with Contact)
│   └── Invoice__c (1:Many)
│       └── Invoice_Line_Item__c (1:Many)
├── bpats__Job__c
│   ├── Billing_Profile__c (Lookup)
│   └── bpats__Placement__c
│       ├── Billing_Profile__c (Inherited)
│       └── ASYMBL_Time__Timesheet__c (1:Many)
│           └── ASYMBL_Time__Time_Entry__c (1:Many)
└── Contact
    └── Additional_Emails__c (Junction)
```

### 7. Integration Points

#### ASYMBL_Time Package Integration
- Successfully integrated with existing `ASYMBL_Time__Timesheet__c` and `ASYMBL_Time__Time_Entry__c` objects
- Added invoicing-specific fields without disrupting existing functionality
- Maintained all existing time tracking capabilities

#### Existing ATS/CRM Integration  
- Enhanced existing `bpats__Job__c` and `bpats__Placement__c` objects

### 8. Security and Data Integrity

#### Field-Level Security
- External ID on Invoice Statement Number for unique identification
- Master-Detail relationships ensure data cascade and security inheritance
- Lookup relationships with appropriate delete constraints

#### Data Validation
- Required field validation on critical objects
- Picklist restrictions for consistent data entry
- Formula field calculations for automatic due date computation

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy Core Objects**: Use the invoicing-deployment-package.xml to deploy all metadata
2. **Configure Picklist Values**: Ensure all picklist values match business requirements
3. **Set Up Billing Profiles**: Create initial billing profiles for existing clients
4. **Activate Validation Rules**: Enable validation rules after data migration
5. **Test Flow Automation**: Verify billing profile inheritance workflow

## Future Enhancements Supported

The implemented solution provides foundation for:
- Advanced invoice splitting and allocation rules
- Multiple invoice templates and PDF generation
